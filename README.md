# hello-world
I'm Yann Jernidier, 3O years old from Guadeloupe in the French West Indies 
I'm learning how to code in order to become a developer within the next two years 
So far , html and css have been pretty fun to learn but I am having some difficulties with git and Github
Thos is my attempt to better my skills and understanding in this area
